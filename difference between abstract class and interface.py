#an abstract class can have abstract methods as well as concrete methods, but all methods of an interface are abstract.

#we use abstract class when there are some commons frature shared by all the objects as they are while we use interface if all the feature need to be implemented differently for different objects.

#its programmer job to write child class for abstract class while in interface , any third party vendor will take responsibility to write child class.

#actually we made interface for this , reason only so that an third party vendor can make a child class. we use interface in API building.

#interface are slow when compared to abstract class.
